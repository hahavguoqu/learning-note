# learning-note
Study AI at SEU:my learing notes.  
I use this to record my learning process and upload my notes here.

The C++ note was organized step by step by myself and retains most of the original content; it has therefore been compiled into a PDF.
The machine learning note is mainly based on Andrew Ng’s online course.
The reinforcement learning note is primarily based on Professor Zhao Shiyu’s online course, available at: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sd4y167NS.
The algorithms and data structures note is partly drawn from OI-WIKI (https://oi-wiki.org/), with the remainder written independently.
